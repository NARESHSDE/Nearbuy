# Nearbuy
Android App for local businesses
The NearBuy App is a portal that allows merchants in developing counters to advertise and sell their goods. This would permit rural communities to make their wares available to the rest of the Srilanka. The objective of this project is to create a portal that would allow product information to be updated securely using a mobile device and will allow users to buy goods from the merchant. The main concern is given to the user to explore their talents and to enhance our traditional Srilankan culture. In the future Mobile Technology whole and soul to the business fields, each and every trade is going to be done through it so this portal may helpful to the user as a business person in this running world.
